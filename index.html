        <p>Kiara was born a <strong>long time</strong> ago and she began her grand journey to look for a wonderful family a <strong>few</strong> months after birth.</p>

    <p>She started spying on the <em>Deras</em> family and noticed they could easily become her <strong>slaves.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Some of the things Kiara noticed they were good at were:</strong></p>

    <ul>
        <li>They eat a lot.</li>
        <li>They love dogs.</li>
        <li>They can be tamed quickly.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Here is the step-by-step plan that Kiara took to become a Deras:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Showed others she was being beaten in her current home.</li>
        <li>Hypnotized a relative and forced her to take her to her home. She believed her name was <em>Vanessa Rubio.</em></li>
        <li>Forced Vanessa Rubio to work harder so that she could noticed she can't take care of her.</li>
        <li>Christmas was the perfect excuse to get into the Deras house. Kiara forced Vanessa to go on vacation and forced her to leave her at the Deras' house for day care.</li>
        <li>Hypnotized the entired Deras family. Then she realized she didn't have to force them to adopt her. Kiara was love at first sight for them.</li>
        <li>Kiara threatened Vanessa to let the Deras adopt her so she made the excuse that she couldn't take care of Kiara anymore.</li>
    </ol>
